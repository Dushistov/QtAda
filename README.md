# QtAda

## Introduction

QtAda is a tool designed for testing Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications developed with the Qt framework. This application supports testing environments either created through QtWidgets or QtQuick/QML interfaces. QtAda is specifically tested and optimized for Linux, with a primary focus on distributions like Arch and Manjaro Linux.

## Features

QtAda's core functionality revolves around automating the recording and saving of test scripts written in JavaScript, based on user interactions within a GUI. It also facilitates the playback of these scripts to evaluate the test results. Users can perform checks on object meta-properties during the recording phase. By selecting a graphical object or an object from the element tree, users can confirm checks of desired meta-properties, which are then included in the generated test script as `QtAda.verify`.

- **Automatic Script Recording:** Capture user interactions within the GUI to generate test scripts.
- **Script Editing:** Modify and enhance generated scripts manually. Care must be taken when editing automatically generated commands.
- **Verification Checks:** During script recording, add checks for object meta-properties to ensure GUI elements adhere to expected standards.

**Note:** QtAda is currently in early development stages and may be prone to various errors. Please proceed with caution.

## Requirements

To use QtAda effectively, your system must meet the following requirements:

### Operating System
- **Linux:** Specifically tested on Manjaro Linux 23.1.4. While QtAda may work on other Linux distributions, functionality is only guaranteed for Manjaro Linux as tested.

### Software Dependencies
To build and run QtAda, ensure the following software is installed:

- **CMake:** Version 3.17 or higher.
- **Compiler:** GCC or Clang.
- **Qt 5.15:** Minimum version 5.15.2. It is crucial to have the following Qt modules installed:
  - `QtCore`
  - `QtQuick`
  - `QtWidgets`
  - `QtRemoteObjects`

### Additional Tools
- **Git:** Necessary for cloning and managing the project repository.

### Optional Dependencies
- **ELF Libraries:** Required for utilizing features that depend on reading ELF headers. Ensure that your system includes paths contain `elf.h` or `sys/elf.h`.

## Installation

To install QtAda on your system, follow these commands:
```
cd existing_repo
git clone https://github.com/lildannita/QtAda.git
cd ./QtAda
./install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

### Console Usage

The console interface is ideal for integrating QtAda's automated test runs into your project's automated tests:
- Preferred for embedding in continuous testing environments.
- Supports various command-line arguments which can be explored using `qtada --help`.

### GUI Usage

The GUI provides a more visual and interactive approach, preferred for creating and managing test scripts:
- **Project File Management:** Create `.qtada` project files to manage test scripts and other necessary files.
- **Script Recording Settings:** Each script recorded via the GUI can have its own unique recording and playback settings.
- **Integrated Text Editor:** Edit scripts directly within the built-in text editor.
- **File Management:** Basic file operations like renaming, deleting, and displaying files in the directory are supported within the GUI.

## Command Documentation

This section outlines the commands available in QtAda for reproducing test actions within a Qt application interface. Note that all commands need to be prefixed with `QtAda.` when used in scripts. The first argument in most commands (except for the sleep functions) is the path to the GUI object, which helps identify the target object in the GUI. Additionally, unless otherwise specified, all functions apply to the classes mentioned and their descendants.

### General Commands

This section details the available commands in QtAda for simulating user actions within a Qt application interface. Note that all commands must be prefixed with `QtAda.` when used in scripts, although they are listed here without this prefix for simplicity. All functions are applicable to the described classes and their descendants, and the first argument, `path` (string), identifies the target GUI object.
